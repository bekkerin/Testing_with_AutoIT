# Testing_with_AutoIT
 Demo project of using black box testing with simple scripting

## Description of the project
The project shows a simple application in Visual C# and how to test it with simple scripting. The scripting language used is AutoIt, a freeware programming language for Microsoft Windows. It resembles the BASIC programming language, and indeed, you can find similarities with older versions of Microsoft Visual Basic 6 too. For instance, data types are variants, and the REM statement is used for commenting. You can find more information about the history on [AutoIt on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt) , and of course on the [AutoIt website](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) itself.
