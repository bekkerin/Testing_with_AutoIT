# Testing_with_AutoIT
 Demo project of using black box testing with simple scripting

## Description of the project
The project shows a simple application in Visual C# and how to test it with simple scripting. The scripting language used is AutoIt, a freeware programming language for Microsoft Windows. It resembles the BASIC programming language, and indeed, you can find similarities with older versions of Microsoft Visual Basic 6 too. For instance, data types are variants, and the REM statement is used for commenting. You can find more information about the history on [AutoIt on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt) , and of course on the [AutoIt website](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) itself.

## Installation
### AutoIt
You can find the installation files for AutoIt on its [download page](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/). The current version is v3.3.16.1, and I suggest that you do a full installation (including x86 and x64 components). During installation, choose the 64 bit tools and editing by default - not running by default. That means that when you open a script, it will automatically open in the SCITE editor rather than run the script. You can always run the script fromt the editor later. The [documentation page](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/) has many good tutorials to get familiar with the language.   
### Visual Studio
The program to be tested is written in Visual C# and Visual Studio is the easiest language to edit and test it. On the [download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), select the Community Edition (free) and make sure that you install Visual C#.
